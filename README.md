# HRB-Coding-Challenge

Hello Nick,
As part of your interviewing process, we would like you to attempt a programming challenge that is related to the work you would be doing in the Automation Engineer position.  
 Attached, you will find a document describing the Application Programming Interface, or API, of a fake device called the MockRobot.  The API describes the commands and format needed to communicate with the robot through its onboard software. 
 Also attached, you will find a description of a pre-existing User Interface program.  This UI program allows a user to control the MockRobot device by calling functions of a Device Driver.
Your programming challenge is to design this Device Driver, conforming to the requirements of the UI program to control a MockRobot through its API. 
 You may use your language of choice to demonstrate all of the required functionality, and while your code does not need to compile, please be as detailed with your solution as possible.  As part of your interview, you will be asked to do a small presentation to explain how your code would work and to defend your design choices. 
 You are not expected to design the perfect solution to the challenge, only to make an earnest attempt to the best of your abilities.  You will be evaluated on the depth of your solution, your ability to describe and defend your solution, and the quality of your presentation.  Ideally, please email me any presentation materials and code by 5pm EST the evening prior to your presentation, so that I and the team may review beforehand or let us know if that deadline is not possible in order to make time to review.
On the day of the presentation, please bring a personal laptop that will be used for the presentation that will be connected to HDMI to present on a large screen in a conference room. If you do not have a laptop that you can bring, please let me know upon submission of your presentation and code so that we can have one prepared for you to use.
If you have any question about the requirements of the challenge itself, please feel free to ask. The presentation should be approximately 20-30min in length and leave time at the end for questions for both sides.  I look forward to seeing what you can come up with!
Thanks, 
Lisa

P.S. You are scheduled to give your presentation on Wednesday, the 14th, beginning at 1:30 PM.  See you then!
